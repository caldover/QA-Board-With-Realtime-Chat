# Determine the Encoding of a HTML Byte Stream

This package implements the HTML Standard's [encoding sniffing algorithm](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#encoding-sniffing-algorithm) in all its glory. The most interesting part of this is how it pre-scans the first 1024 bytes in order to search for certain `<meta charset>`-related patterns.

```js
const htmlEncodingSniffer = require("html-encoding-sniffer");
const fs = require("fs");

const htmlBuffer = fs.readFileSync("./html-page.html");
